# Backlog

This document serves as a parking lot for ideas, improvements, and future work that are out of scope for the current task.

## How to Use

When working on a task and you think of something that would be nice to have but is out of scope:

1. Add it here instead of implementing it
2. Include enough context so you (or someone else) can pick it up later
3. Don't let it derail your current work
