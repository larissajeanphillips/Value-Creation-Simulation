# Glossary

Plain-English definitions of technical terms you might encounter.

## A

### API
**Application Programming Interface** - A way for different software to talk to each other. Think of it like a waiter taking your order to the kitchen and bringing back your food.

### API Key
A secret password that lets your app access external services. Keep it private - don't share it or put it in public code.

---

## B

### Backend
The "behind the scenes" part of your app that handles data, logic, and connections to other services. Users don't see it directly.

### Build
The process of converting your code into something that can actually run. Like compiling a recipe into an actual dish.

---

## C

### CLI (Command Line Interface)
A text-based way to interact with your computer by typing commands. The black window where you type things like `npm run dev`.

### Commit
Saving a snapshot of your code changes. Like creating a restore point you can go back to.

### Component
A reusable piece of your user interface. A button, a form, a card - each is a component that can be used in multiple places.

### Container (Docker)
A self-contained "bubble" that runs your app with everything it needs. Your app runs inside it without affecting the rest of your computer.

---

## D

### Deployment
The process of making your app available on the internet for others to use.

### Docker
Think of Docker like a cake-baking kit: instead of gathering ingredients yourself, you get everything pre-measured and ready to go. Docker bundles your app with everything it needs so you don't have to install programming tools on your computer. You install one app (Docker Desktop) and everything just works.

### Docker Desktop
A free application you install on your Mac or Windows computer. Once it's running, you can run apps that are packaged with Docker - including this one!

---

## E

### Environment Variables

### Error
Something went wrong. The app will usually show a message explaining what happened.

---

## F

### FastAPI
A Python framework for building the backend of web applications. It handles requests from users and sends back responses.

### Frontend
The part of your app that users see and interact with - the buttons, forms, and visual elements.

---

## G

### Git
A system for tracking changes to your code over time. Lets you see what changed, when, and go back if needed.

### GitHub
A website for storing and sharing code. Like Dropbox for code, with version history and collaboration features.

---

## H

### Hot Reloading
When changes you make appear immediately without restarting the app. Saves time during development.

### HTTP

---

## M

### Model (AI)
A trained AI system. Different models have different capabilities and costs. GPT-4, Claude, etc. are all models.

---

## N

### Node.js

### npm

---

## P

### Port
A number that identifies a specific service on a computer. Port 3000 is commonly used for web apps in development.

### Python
A programming language. Used for the backend of this app.

### Push
Uploading your code changes to GitHub so others can see them.

---

## R

### React
A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Used for the frontend of this app.

### Repository (Repo)
A folder containing your project's code and its entire history. Stored on GitHub.

### REST API
A common pattern for building APIs. Uses standard HTTP methods like GET (fetch data) and POST (send data).

### Routing (Agent)
The process of deciding which AI agent should handle a user's question based on keywords or content.

---

## S

### Server
A computer (or program) that provides services to other computers. Your app's backend is a server.

## T

### Tailwind CSS
