# Build Your Web App

Welcome! This project helps you create a professional web application using Cursor - **no coding experience required**.

## Getting Started

**The AI in Cursor will guide you through everything.** Just follow these steps:

### Step 1: Open Cursor Chat

Click the chat icon (bottom right) or press `Cmd+L` (Mac) / `Ctrl+L` (Windows).

### Step 2: Say Hello

The AI will welcome you automatically, or type `/welcome` to get started.

### Step 3: Set Up Your App

Type `/setup` to launch the guided wizard. It will ask you:
- What kind of app you're building
- What features you need
- What you want it to look like

### Step 4: Start Building

After setup, your app will open at **http://localhost:3000**. Then just describe what you want:
- "Add a chart showing sales by month"
- "Create a form for collecting feedback"
- "Make the header blue"

**The AI writes the code. You see the results.**
