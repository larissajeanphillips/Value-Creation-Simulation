# Agent Routing Configuration
#
# This file defines how objectives are routed to specialized agents.
# The routing system uses keywords and descriptions to select the best agent for each task.
#
# EXAMPLE: This configuration shows automotive cost optimization agents
# Replace these with your own industry-specific agents

    # Specialized agent for electrical architecture
    - name: electricalarch
      keywords:
        - electrical
        - architecture
        - ECU
        - wiring
        - harness
        - controller
        - domain controller
        - zonal
        - CAN bus
      description: >-
        Specializes in electrical architecture cost optimization.
        Use for objectives related to ECUs (Electronic Control Units),
        electrical systems, wiring harnesses, domain controllers,
        zonal architectures, or electrical component consolidation.

    # Default fallback agent
    - name: catchall
      keywords: []  # Empty keywords = matches everything not caught by other agents
      description: >-
        General-purpose cost optimization agent for any automotive
        component or system. Use when no specialized agent matches
        the objective.

# How Routing Works:
#
# 1. Keyword Matching: If the objective contains any keywords from an agent's list,
#    that agent is prioritized
#
# 2. LLM-Based Routing: If no clear keyword match, the routing system uses an LLM
#    to analyze the objective and select the best agent based on descriptions
#
# 3. Fallback: If routing is uncertain, defaults to the catchall agent
#
# Best Practices:
# - List agents from most specific to least specific
# - Put catchall agent last (it should always have empty keywords)
# - Use clear, distinct keywords that don't overlap too much
# - Write descriptions that explain WHEN to use each agent
# - Include domain-specific terminology in keywords
