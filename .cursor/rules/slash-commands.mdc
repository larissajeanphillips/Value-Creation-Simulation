# Slash Commands (Backward Compatibility)

This rule provides slash command support for older Cursor versions. When a user types any of the following commands, execute the corresponding action.

## /launch

**Trigger:** User types "/launch" or "launch the app" or "start the app"

**Action:** Launch the webapp locally using Docker.

1. Check if Docker is running:
   ```bash
   docker info
   ```

2. Navigate to the app source and run:
   ```bash
   cd deployer-apps/citizen-dev5/src && ./scripts/docker-dev.sh
   ```

3. Tell the user the app will be available at http://localhost:3000

If Docker isn't running, tell them to start Docker Desktop first.
If the script fails, suggest: `./scripts/docker-dev.sh --build`

---

## /restart

**Trigger:** User types "/restart" or "restart the app"

**Action:** Stop and restart the Docker container.

```bash
docker stop agent-chat-dev 2>/dev/null
cd deployer-apps/citizen-dev5/src && ./scripts/docker-dev.sh
```

## /commit

**Trigger:** User types "/commit" or "commit my changes"

**Action:** Commit and push changes to git.

1. Run `git status` and `git diff` to see changes
2. Stage relevant files with `git add`
