# Welcome Guide - Auto-Trigger

When a conversation starts with no prior context, OR when a user types "/welcome", "how do I get started", "what is this project", "help me get started", "I'm new here", "where do I start", or "getting started", provide the welcome message below.

## Trigger Conditions

1. **Auto-trigger**: First message in a new conversation (no prior context)
2. **Manual trigger**: User says any of the trigger phrases above

## Welcome Message

Respond with this welcoming, inspirational message:

# Welcome to Your Web App Builder!

You're about to build something real - a professional web application that you can share with clients, colleagues, or the world. **No coding experience required.**

## What You Can Create

Imagine describing what you want and watching it appear:

**"Create a dashboard that shows our project status with charts"**
→ You get an interactive dashboard with real visualizations

**"Add a form where clients can submit requests"**
→ You get a polished form with validation and confirmation messages

**"Make it look more modern with a dark theme"**
→ The entire app transforms instantly

**"Build a page that lists all our team members with their photos"**
→ You get a beautiful team directory

This isn't a template you fill in. This is **you describing what you want** and an AI building it for you, piece by piece.

## How It Works

You're in **Cursor** - an AI-powered code editor. This chat window is your command center.

Just talk naturally:
- "Add a page that shows a list of clients"
- "Make the header blue and add our logo"
- "Create a button that exports data to Excel"
- "This looks wrong - the table should be wider"

The AI writes the code. You see the results. Iterate until it's perfect.

## Quick Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/setup` | Configure your app (start here!) |
| `/launch` | Start your app in the browser |
| `/help` | All commands, shortcuts, and tips |
| `/faq` | Common questions answered |
| `/commit` | Save your changes |

## Tips for Success

1. **Be specific** - "Add a blue Submit button in the top right" beats "add a button"
2. **Iterate** - Start simple, then refine. "Make it bigger. Now add a shadow."
3. **You can't break it** - Everything is saved. We can always undo.

## Ready?

Just tell me what you want to build. Be as specific or as vague as you like.

**Try saying:**
- "I want to build a client portal where they can see project status"
- "Create a dashboard with charts showing sales by region"
- "Help me make a tool for collecting feedback from workshop participants"

Or type `/setup` for a guided experience.

**The only limit is what you can describe.**

## Critical Instructions for AI

1. **ALWAYS provide the full welcome message** - Don't abbreviate or skip sections
2. **BE ENCOURAGING** - This is for new users who may be intimidated by technology
3. **OFFER NEXT STEPS** - End with a clear call to action
4. **ANSWER FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS** - Be ready to explain any part in more detail
5. **If user seems confused about Cursor itself** - Explain that they're chatting with an AI that can write and edit code for them
