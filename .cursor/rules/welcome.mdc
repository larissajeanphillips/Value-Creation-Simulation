## Welcome to the New Project Creation Kit! 

This is a starter template that helps you quickly create new React + TypeScript + Vite projects with Cursor AI support already configured.

### What This Kit Does

This template provides:
- **Pre-configured Cursor AI rules** - Coding standards, commit messages, and best practices
- **Code templates** - Ready-to-use React components, hooks, and stores
- **Design system** - Style guide and design tokens for consistent UI
- **Deployment configs** - Docker and AWS ECS templates
- **Automation scripts** - Create new projects with a single command

### Quick Start - Just Use Cursor (Easiest)

No installs required - just clone and start coding with Cursor's built-in AI.

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/McK-Internal/citizen-dev5.git
```

**Step 2: Open in Cursor**
- `File` → `Open Folder` → Select `citizen-dev5`

**That's it!** Cursor's AI is ready to help you explore, edit, and build. Try:
- Ask Cursor: "Explain the project structure"
- Ask Cursor: "How do I add a new agent?"
- Type `/welcome` for this guide anytime

### Quick Start - Docker (Preview the UI)

If you want to **preview the chat UI**, use Docker. Only requires Docker installed.

**Step 1: Clone and Navigate**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/McK-Internal/citizen-dev5.git
cd citizen-dev5/deployer-apps/citizen-dev5/src
```

**Step 2: Run with Docker**
```bash
./scripts/docker-dev.sh
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

**Getting Docker:**
- McKinsey users: [Docker for Business](https://mckinsey.service-now.com/ghd?id=mck_app_cat_item&table=pc_software_cat_item&sys_id=157a289187c6c1d0011e52c83cbb35ef)
- Alternative: [Podman Desktop](https://platform.mckinsey.com/team/no-team/create-service/d4a3647c-10ee-44da-848d-b7a52610f633)

---

### Optional: Embed a Chatbot in Your Webapp

If you want the agents to actually respond to messages (not just preview the UI), you'll need AI Gateway credentials:

```bash
cat > .env << 'EOF'
AI_GATEWAY_INSTANCE_ID=your_instance_id
AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY=your_api_key
EOF
```

Get credentials from [Platform McKinsey → AI Gateway](https://platform.mckinsey.com). This connects your app to LLMs (GPT, Claude, etc.) through McKinsey's enterprise gateway.

---

### Quick Start - Local Development (Alternative)

If you prefer local development without Docker:

**Step 1: Create Your New Project**

Type in chat:
```
Set up a new project
```

This launches an interactive wizard that asks you:
- Project name
- Where to save it
- Optional: description, GitHub repo, team name

**Step 2: Navigate to Your New Project**

Once created, open your new project folder in Cursor:
- `File` → `Open Folder` → Select your new project

**Step 3: Start Development**

In your project's terminal:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.
