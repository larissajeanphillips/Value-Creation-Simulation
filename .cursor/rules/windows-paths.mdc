# Windows Default Installation Paths

When running on Windows, the following tools are typically installed at these locations.
If commands like `git`, `node`, or `npm` are not found in PATH, check these locations.

## Git

**Default installation path:**
```
C:\Program Files\Git\cmd
C:\Program Files\Git\bin
```

The `git.exe` executable is located at:
```
C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\git.exe
```

## Node.js

**Default installation path:**
```
C:\Program Files\nodejs
```

The executables are located at:
```
C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe
C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.cmd
C:\Program Files\nodejs\npx.cmd
```

## Adding to PATH (for current session)

If tools are installed but not in PATH, you can add them temporarily in PowerShell:

```powershell
# Add Git to PATH
$env:Path = "C:\Program Files\Git\cmd;$env:Path"

# Add Node.js to PATH
$env:Path = "C:\Program Files\nodejs;$env:Path"

# Verify
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

## Permanent PATH Fix

Run the included fix script:
```powershell
.\scripts\fix-git-path.ps1
```

Or manually:
1. Open System Properties > Environment Variables
2. Edit the User PATH variable
3. Add: `C:\Program Files\Git\cmd` and `C:\Program Files\nodejs`
4. Restart PowerShell/terminals

## Common Issues

### "git is not recognized"

### esbuild installation fails
Windows permission issue. Use:
```powershell

Or run the fix script:
```powershell
.\scripts\fix-windows-npm.ps1
```
