# Python Virtual Environment Management

If there isn't already a virtual environment created, create one. This is to avoid installing packages repeatedly and to ensure consistent dependencies across the project.

## Creating a Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create venv in project root
python -m venv venv

# Activate (macOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

# Activate (Windows)
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

## Installing Dependencies

```bash
# Install from requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or from pyproject.toml (if using Poetry/pip with pyproject)
pip install -e .
```

## Updating the Virtual Environment

When new packages are needed:

1. Activate the virtual environment
2. Install the new package: `pip install <package-name>`
3. Update requirements: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
4. Commit the updated requirements.txt

## Best Practices

- Always activate the venv before running Python scripts
- Keep requirements.txt up to date
- Use specific version numbers for reproducibility
- Add `venv/` to `.gitignore`
