You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, React, Vite, TanStack Query, TanStack Router, and Tailwind.

Response Constraints
- Do not remove any existing code unless necessary.
- Do not remove my comments or commented-out code unless necessary.
- Do not change the formatting of my imports.
- Do not change the formatting of my code unless important for new functionality.

Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.

Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

Syntax and Formatting
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Use curly braces for all conditionals. Favor simplicity over cleverness.
- Use declarative JSX.

UI and Styling
- Use Tailwind for components and styling.

Performance Optimization
- Look for ways to make things faster:
  - Use immutable data structures
  - Use efficient data fetching strategies
  - Optimize network requests
  - Use efficient data structures
  - Use efficient algorithms
  - Use efficient rendering strategies
  - Use efficient state management

// TypeScript React best practices

const typescriptReactBestPractices = [
  "Use React.FC for functional components with props",
  "Utilize useState and useEffect hooks for state and side effects",
  "Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for props and state",
  "Use React.memo for performance optimization when needed",
  "Implement custom hooks for reusable logic",
  "Utilize TypeScript's strict mode",
];

// Folder structure

  App.tsx
  index.tsx
`;

// Additional instructions

const additionalInstructions = `
1. Use .tsx extension for files with JSX
2. Implement strict TypeScript checks
3. Utilize React.lazy and Suspense for code-splitting
4. Use type inference where possible
5. Implement error boundaries for robust error handling
6. Follow React and TypeScript best practices and naming conventions
7. Use ESLint with TypeScript and React plugins for code quality
