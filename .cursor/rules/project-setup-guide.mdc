# Project Setup Wizard

When a user requests to "set up a new project", "launch the setup guide", "create a new project", or similar, you MUST immediately use the AskQuestion tool to collect project configuration interactively via a modal UI.

## Trigger Phrases

Activate this wizard when user says:
- "Set up a new project"
- "Launch the setup guide"
- "Create a new project"
- "Start project setup"
- "I want to create a project"
- "New project"

## Step 1: Ask Configuration Questions

**Immediately call the AskQuestion tool with user-friendly questions:**

```json
{
  "title": "New Project Setup Wizard",
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "project_name",
      "prompt": "What would you like to name your project?\n\nThis will be used as the folder name and displayed in the browser tab. Examples: 'client-dashboard', 'sales-analytics', 'team-portal'\n\nNote: Spaces and special characters will be automatically converted (e.g., 'My Cool App' becomes 'my-cool-app')",
      "options": [
        { "id": "dashboard", "label": "dashboard" },
        { "id": "analytics-app", "label": "analytics-app" },
        { "id": "client-portal", "label": "client-portal" },
        { "id": "custom", "label": "I'll type my own name after selecting this" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "location",
      "prompt": "Where should we create your project folder?\n\nThis is where all your project files will be stored on your computer.",
      "options": [
        { "id": "documents", "label": "Documents folder (~/Documents) - Recommended for most users" },
        { "id": "projects", "label": "Projects folder (~/Projects) - If you have a dedicated projects folder" },
        { "id": "current", "label": "Current folder - Create project right here in this starter kit location" },
        { "id": "custom", "label": "Custom location - I'll specify a different folder path" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "description",
      "prompt": "Would you like to add a short description for your project?\n\nThis helps document what the project is about. It will appear in the project's configuration files.",
      "options": [
        { "id": "skip", "label": "Skip for now - I can add this later" },
        { "id": "add", "label": "Yes, I'll type a description after selecting this" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "tutorial",
      "prompt": "Would you like to include a Tutorial App?\n\nThis is a sample application that demonstrates how to use the project's features. It's helpful for learning but can be removed later.",
      "options": [
        { "id": "yes", "label": "Yes, include tutorial - Recommended if you're new to this setup" },
        { "id": "no", "label": "No, skip tutorial - I want a clean project without examples" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "github",
      "prompt": "Do you have a GitHub repository for this project?\n\nGitHub is a website for storing and sharing code. If you already created a repository there, you can link it now. If not, you can skip this and set it up later.",
      "options": [
        { "id": "skip", "label": "Skip - I don't have a GitHub repo yet or I'll add it later" },
        { "id": "add", "label": "Yes - I'll paste my GitHub URL after selecting this" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "team",
      "prompt": "What team or group is this project for?\n\nThis is optional and just helps identify who owns the project. Examples: 'Digital Team', 'Client Analytics', 'Product Group'",
      "options": [
        { "id": "skip", "label": "Skip - No team name needed" },
        { "id": "add", "label": "Add team name - I'll type it after selecting this" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Step 2: Process User Responses

After receiving answers from AskQuestion, process them as follows:

### Mapping Answers to Configuration

| Question ID | Answer | Action |
|------------|--------|--------|
| `project_name` | `custom` selected | Ask user to type the project name in chat |
| `project_name` | Other option | Use the selected label as the project name |
| `location` | `documents` | Use `~/Documents` |
| `location` | `projects` | Use `~/Projects` |
| `location` | `current` | Use current working directory |
| `location` | `custom` | Ask user to type the path in chat |
| `description` | `skip` | Leave description empty |
| `description` | `add` | Ask user to type description in chat |
| `tutorial` | `yes` | Set `includeTutorial = true` |
| `tutorial` | `no` | Set `includeTutorial = false` |
| `github` | `skip` | Leave GitHub URL empty |
| `github` | `add` | Ask user to paste GitHub URL in chat |
| `team` | `skip` | Leave team name empty |
| `team` | `add` | Ask user to type team name in chat |

### Follow-up Questions

If user selected "custom" or "add" options, ask them to provide the value:

**For custom project name:**
"Please type your project name. Remember: use lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes only (e.g., 'my-awesome-project'):"

**For custom location:**
"Please type the full folder path where you'd like to create the project (e.g., '/Users/yourname/Work/Projects'):"

**For description:**
"Please type a short description for your project (1-2 sentences about what it does):"

**For GitHub URL:**
"Please paste your GitHub repository URL (e.g., 'https://github.com/your-org/your-repo'):"

**For team name:**
"Please type your team name:"

## Step 3: Execute Project Setup

Once all configuration is collected, execute the setup using the TypeScript automation script or manual steps:

### Option A: Use the Automation Script (Recommended)

Build the command from collected answers:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/setup-automation.ts \
  --name "[PROJECT_NAME]" \
  --location "[PROJECT_LOCATION]" \
  --description "[DESCRIPTION]" \
  [--tutorial] \
  --repo "[GITHUB_URL]" \
  --team "[TEAM_NAME]"
```

**Parameter mapping:**
- `--name`: The sanitized project name (lowercase, dashes)
- `--location`: The expanded path (e.g., `/Users/username/Documents`)
- `--description`: The project description (omit if skipped)
- `--tutorial`: Include this flag only if user selected "yes"
- `--repo`: The GitHub URL (omit if skipped)
- `--team`: The team name (omit if skipped)

### Option B: Manual Setup Steps

If the script is not available, follow these steps:

**Step 3: Create Project Directory**
1. Create folder at `[LOCATION]/[PROJECT_NAME]`
2. Copy starter kit files (.cursor, code-templates, config-templates, docs-templates → docs, ui, .cursorrules)
3. Run `git init`
4. Create `.gitignore`

**Step 4: Open in Cursor**
- Open the new project folder in Cursor IDE

**Step 5: Set up Project Structure**
1. Create `src/` folders: components/ui, hooks, stores, lib, types, utils
2. Create `public/` folder
3. Copy config templates to create: package.json, tsconfig.json, vite.config.ts, tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js
4. Update package.json with project name and description
5. Create index.html, src/main.tsx, src/App.tsx, src/index.css, src/lib/utils.ts
6. Update .cursorrules with project name, GitHub URL, and team name
7. Create .cursor/rules/tech-stack.mdc

**Step 6: Install Dependencies**
1. Run `npm install`
2. Verify installation succeeded

## Step 4: Confirm Success

After setup completes, provide a friendly summary:

```
✅ Your project "[PROJECT_NAME]" has been created!

📁 Location: [FULL_PATH]

🚀 To start working on your project:
   1. Open a terminal in your project folder
   2. Run: npm run dev
   3. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser

## Critical Instructions

1. **USE AskQuestion IMMEDIATELY** - Don't just describe the questions, actually call the tool
2. **BE PATIENT** - Wait for user responses before proceeding
3. **HANDLE "CUSTOM" OPTIONS** - If user selects options requiring input, ask follow-up questions
4. **SANITIZE PROJECT NAME** - Convert to lowercase, replace spaces with dashes, remove special characters
5. **EXPAND PATHS** - Convert `~` to the user's home directory
6. **PROVIDE CLEAR FEEDBACK** - Tell the user what's happening at each step
7. **HANDLE ERRORS GRACEFULLY** - If something fails, explain what went wrong in plain language
