# Tips for Success

## Be Specific

The more detail you give, the better the result.

| Instead of... | Try... |
|---------------|--------|
| "Add a button" | "Add a blue Submit button in the top right corner" |
| "Make it look better" | "Add more whitespace and make the fonts larger" |
| "Add a form" | "Add a contact form with name, email, and message fields" |
| "It's broken" | "The button appears but nothing happens when I click it" |

## Iterate Step by Step

Don't try to build everything at once. Small steps get better results.

**Good approach:**
1. "Add a chart"
2. "Make it a bar chart"
3. "Change the colors to blue"
4. "Add a title above it"
5. "Make the labels bigger"

**Instead of:**
"Add a blue bar chart with a title, large labels, and specific colors for each bar"

## Describe What You See vs. What You Want

When something isn't right, describe both:

**"The header is gray but I want it to be dark blue."**

**"The sidebar is on the right, but it should be on the left."**

**"The form submits but there's no confirmation message."**

---

## Use Natural Language

You don't need to use technical terms. Just describe what you want like you're talking to a colleague.

✓ "Make the header sticky so it stays at the top when I scroll"
✓ "Add a loading spinner while the data loads"  
✓ "Put the logo in the top left corner"
✓ "Make the text wrap instead of getting cut off"

## Save Your Progress

Use `/commit` after each milestone. This creates save points you can go back to.

Good times to commit:
- After getting a feature working
- Before trying something risky
- At the end of a work session
- When you're happy with how something looks

---

## Ask Questions

Learning as you go? Ask why:

- "Explain why this code works"
- "What would happen if I changed X?"
- "Is there a better way to do this?"
- "What does this error mean?"

---

## The Magic Phrases

These phrases tend to work really well:

**For polish:**
- "Make it look more professional"
- "Add some sample data so I can see how it looks"
- "Clean up the spacing"

**For iteration:**
- "This is close but [specific feedback]"
- "Almost - just change [one thing]"
- "Perfect, now let's add..."

**For troubleshooting:**
- "Why isn't this working?"
- "What changed since it was working?"
- "Show me the error in more detail"

---

## You Can't Break It

Everything is saved in Git. If something goes wrong:

- **Small mistake:** Cmd+Z / Ctrl+Z to undo
- **Bigger mistake:** "Undo the last few changes"
- **Need to start fresh:** "Let's go back to when [X] was working"
- **Total reset:** "Start over from the beginning"

**There's no mistake I can't help you recover from.**

## When You're Stuck

Try these approaches:

1. **Show me what you're seeing** - Screenshots or descriptions help
2. **Break it down** - What's one small thing you want to change?
3. **Describe the goal** - Sometimes I can suggest a better approach
4. **Take a break** - Fresh eyes often see the solution

---

## Remember

- **No coding knowledge needed** - I write the code
- **No question is too basic** - I'm here to help
- **Iteration is normal** - Getting it right takes a few tries
- **The only limit is what you can describe**

---

**Ready to build?** Just tell me what you want!
